## whatsapp_log_analysis

### Although WhatsApp doesnâ€™t reveal a public API, it does allow users to export their chat history into a *.txt file. With this data, I decided to use PYTHON and try some analysis about groups I belong. The aim of the project is to determine:

#### I) The most "active" year, in terms of messages sent;
#### II) The most active member on the group (highest number of messages sent);
#### III) The activity per hour (30 minutes windows) across the days (per member);
#### IV) The most "image sender member" and "audio sender member";
#### V) The most typing member (characters per message);

##### p.s.: I want to evolve with this project, adding more analyses and developing some visualization.
