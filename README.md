# whatsapp_log_analysis

## Although WhatsApp doesnâ€™t reveal a public API, it does allow users to export their chat history into a *.txt file.

## With this information at hand, I decided to try some analysis about groups I belong. The aim of the project is to determine:

### The most "active" year, in terms of messages sent;
### The most active member on the group (highest number of messages sent);
### The activity per hour (30 minutes windows) across the days (per member);
### The most "image sender member" and "audio sender member";
### The most typing member (characters per message);

### I want to evolve with this project, adding more analyses and developing some visualization.
