## Whatsapp log analysis

Although WhatsApp doesnâ€™t have a public API, it does allow users to export their chat history into a txt file.

With this data and using Python, I tried some analysis about chat groups I belong. 

The aim of the project is to determine:

##### - The most "active" year, in terms of messages sent;
##### - The most active member on the group (highest number of messages sent);
##### - The activity per hour (30 minutes windows) across the days (per member);
##### - The most "image sender" member and "audio sender" member;
##### - The most typing member (characters per message);
