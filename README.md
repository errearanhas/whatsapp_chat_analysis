Although WhatsApp doesnâ€™t have a public API, it does allow users to export their chat history into a txt file.

With this data (from Android OS) and using Python, I tried some analysis about chat groups I belong.

The project goals are to determine:

- the most "active" year, in terms of messages sent;
- the most active member on the group (highest number of messages sent);
- the activity per hour (30 minutes windows) across the days (per member);
- the most "image sender" member and "audio sender" member;
- the most typing member (characters per message);
